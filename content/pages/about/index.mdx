Hi ðŸ‘‡

My name is Enes Kutlay, and I'm a Computer Science student at Ecole 42. I love learning new things, researching, and writing. I have been dealing with software as an amateur for about a year. At first, I focused on front-end development. Then I started learning C with Ecole42. Now I'm interested in blockchain, smart contracts, and cyber security besides C language. Here you can review the open-source projects I have developed and the blog posts on many different topics. These days, I'm particularly obsessed with these issues.
- Vim
- Cybersecurity fundamentals
- Fundamentals of Blockchain | Smart contract security
    - PoW algorithm
    - Key management
    - Identity and access management
- Memory Management (in C)

It's complicated, but whatever. It's better that way when everything is messy, you need to work harder and be more disciplined, and I like it that way ðŸŽ‰
